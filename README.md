# hockey_graphs

hockey_graphs is private software project to create a set of tools rendering charts based on statistics from [Penny-DEL](https://www.penny-del.org/)

The latest version is hosted at [http://hockeygraphs.dynamop.de/](https://hockeygraphs.dynamop.de/) and contains various charts based on data from
- 2019/2020 season
- [Magenta Sport Hockey Cup](https://www.magentasport.de/eishockey/magentasportcup)
- 2020/2021 season

## Project status

The project is under heavy development.  So far charts for single del-matches will be provided. Team-statistics, team benchmarking and player statistics are on my todo-list and will hopefully follow soon.

In case you are missing a certain chart you would like to see let me know. Just create an [issue](https://github.com/grindsa/hockey_graphs/issues/new) or drop an email to <grindelsack@gmail.com>. Suggestions for improvements and objective criticism are welcome at any time.

If you are interested in raw (but much more detailed statistics) please visit [leaffan.net](https://www.leaffan.net/del/#!/home). That's by far the best page for advanced statistics of Penny-DEL.   

## Disclaimer

I am not a professional software developer. Main aim for this project was to do something useful while being stuck in COVID prison. Keep this in mind while laughing about my code and donâ€™t forget to send patches.

I do neither work for (P-)DEL nor any of the German hockey clubs. I just found the raw data while checking [penny-del.org](https://www.penny-del.org/) and started playing with it.

## Architecture

The project is split into two parts:
- a [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) based backend providing a [REST-API](https://hockeygraphs.dynamop.de/api/v1/) for data fetching
- a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) based frontend

The charts are being generated by using [highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)
